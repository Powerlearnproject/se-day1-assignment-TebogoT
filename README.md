Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
  Software Engineering is the development of software systems, from the design phase all the way to production phase.
  They are very important in our daily lives based on how relient we are on them in order to make our lives easier, we can survive without them but that will make life harder and set us back a 100 years before they became the norm, since they are every where, ranging 
  from our mobile phones to in cars and much much more.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
  The obvious ones would be:
  Mobile phones, Computers and transportant.
  They have all played a key role in accelerating human evolution.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
  1) Planning: It is the initial stage of planning the softwares purpose and scope, such as planning the softwares end goal or function and route to get there.
  2) Requirements Analysis: This phase lists all the requirements needed to make the software function properly, such as user and stakeholder needs etc.
  3) Design: This phase deals with the building the framework of the software outlining its functionality and aesthetics.
  4) Coding: It is when the engineers and developers start building the software, turning the software into workable code.
  5) Testing: The testing phase deals with checking for bugs or any issues that may have been missed during the previous phases, making sure it is a flawless software. It may also involve user testing.
  6) Deployment: It involves rolling out the software to the end-user, and making sure it is used as how it is intended to.
  7) Maintenance: This phase deals with offering constant assistance and improvement of the software in order to make sure it functions as best as possible, lasts long and also meeting end-user expectations.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
  Waterfall and agile methodologies are used as a form of project management in a wide range of industries but are mainly known or popular in the technology industry, in the technology industry the waterfall methodology has been around for a very long time, offering a 
  more linear and sequential development process were each process or phase needs to be completed before progressing to the next phase. Unlike the waterfall methodology the agile methodology is a much newer process that offers a more robust and adaptable/flexible 
  project management were it deals more with a continous improvement, customer feedback and small, incremental releases of work.
  
  Waterfall Methodologies uses or scenarios: small to medium-sized projects, infrastructure projects, construction, and legacy software.
  Agile Methodologies uses or scenarios: small to large-sized projects, start-ups, software development, and dynamic projects.



Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
  a) Software Developer:They are responsible for the functionality and coding of the software, from writing, designing, testing, and maintaining the code.
  b) Quality Assurance Engineer: They are responsible for the quality of the project, making sure it is functional and bug-free, meeting the needs for the end-user and the stakeholders, they focus on doing tests and indentifying any issues.
  c) Project Manager: They are the managers of the project, responsible for overseeing the entire development process, making sure it is within budget, meets end-user needs and the scope.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
  Integrated Development Environment (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) help with the streamlining of the software development lifecycle, improve collaboration, making sure projects are managed well, flexible and maintainable.
  IDEs helps by incorparting tools that help developers write, debug and manage code effeciently.
    a) Visual Studio
    b) Xcode
    c) Andriod Studio
  VCS helps with collabaration and code management, by enabling developers the flexibility to work on different aspects of a project simutaneously, track changes, and maintain history of the project.
    a) Git
    b) Github
    c) Bitbucket


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
  a) Debugging and fixing bugs: it can be overcome by using effective debugging tools ( such as variable watches ), write unit test, log and trace, collaborate with peers ( peer programming )
  b) Managing complex large codebases: it can be overcome ny using modular design, follow code standards, refactoring and documentation.
  c) Communication and Collaboration chanllenges: It can be overcome by clear documentation, frequent check-ins, active listening and collaboration tools.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
  a) Unit testing: it is testing individual components or functions of the software in isolation.
    It is important because it helps with early bug detection, faster development and also improving the code quality
  b) Integration testing: It is used to verify tht components work together properly
    It is important because it helps with detecting interference issues, early detection of integration problems and improves collaboration
  c) System testing: It helps by testing the entire software maing sure everything works as it should, and that it is integrated as it should.
    It is important because it helps with uncovering system issues, compliance requirements and comprehensive validation.
  d) Acceptance testing: it helps by determing if the software meets the business requirements and is ready for release.
    It is important because it helps with stakeholder confidence, business requirements validation and user-focused

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
  Prompt engineering is when you design and refininf inputs that would be used in the AI model to get the desired ouput, making sure the prompt is effeciently designed to better allow the AI to give quality and desired results.
  It is a crucial skill for interacting with AI Models since the inputs or prompt need to be precise, have quality and problem solving, by designing well-defined and context-rich prompts, the user can optimize the inputs to get the desired outputs


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
  a) Tell me about world war 2
  b) Explain the main reasons that led to Germany starting world war 2
